## The Blockumentary

As a kid who was born and raised in the 80's, it was nearly impossible to escape the surging influence of hip hop culture. Living in a multi-cultural neighborhood in Southeast San Diego, every kid on our block used to spend afternoons in the cul de sac, listening to cassettes and playing some random pick-up game.

That's the thing, there was this culture, a young and raw hip-hop culture that united a variety of backgrounds with one common thread.


## The Project

I'm hoping to share my story, of a child who grew up in a neighborhood full of influences, some were good, however, most were potentially destructive. But, I hope to capture and retell some of the life-determining histories behind who I am today. 

## What to expect

Maybe it's a memoir, an autobiography of some sort, but what I'm hoping to accomplish is a series of produced podcasts that take the listener on a journey.
